<p>Generally we divide college students into four groups: freshman, sophomore, junior and senior. But for me, I am outside the four categories. 
I am a fifth grade student. I studied 2 years at a Chinese college and then continued my study at University of Iowa until now. 
Because of the experience, many of my friends asked me why you didn’t finish the Bachelor Degree in China. My answer was always two words, my major. 
</p>

<p>
Before talking about my major, I want to introduce myself. My name is Chang Shang. As I have mentioned, I am from China. 
I grew up in a small town and lived there until I graduated from the local high school. After that, I went to one Chinese university, studying pharmacy. 
To be a qualified pharmacy student, I had to do animal experimentations which were my nightmare. I remembered sometimes we had to cut animals’ heads or take their organs. 
I really did not like this kind of stuff and looked for an opportunity to change my major. But changing major was not an easy thing in my college. 
So I finally studied abroad and went to University of Iowa. But except the experiments, I enjoyed my Chinese college life a lot. I met lots of amusing guys and we soon became good friends. 
We did many things together, such as playing video game or travelling. 
</P>

<p>
Here in Iowa I studied finance. I shifted my attention from animals to interest rates. 
I am a big basketball fan. Before went to US, I watched many NBA games on TV. One of my dreams is to watch an NBA live game. Fortunately, it came true in my first semester. 
I watched the Chicago Bulls game with my friends. Now my next dream is to apply for a graduate school since I am going to graduate next summer. 
Hopefully it will become true as soon as possible.
